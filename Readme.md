# About Me
Hi my name is Chuan or Shawn ðŸ˜ƒ,   
My goal is to eventually publish my own games on steam, hopefully learning new things along the way. If you wish to contact me please email me at [ chuan.chen.info@gmail.com ] I hope you liked my profile. I also like to build computers for fun, make video game servers, and do wacky home projects. 

Mantra: Nothing is ever complete but is always in the process of completion. The only constant is change, and that is what I am here for to be the constant.
